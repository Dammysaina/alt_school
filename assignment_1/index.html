      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Oluwadamilola Adeoti Inyene-Etoedia. I graduated from
        Covenant University in 2015 with BSc in Industrial Physics: Applied
        Geophysics. I got interested in Engineering due to relationships. My
        friends would be speaking and i wasn't able to contribute so i decided
        to learn myself and i started with using W3schools to learn HTML and
        CSS. I went on further to enrol in a software engineering role where i
        learnt the MERN (Mongodb, ExpressJS, ReactJs and NodeJs) stack but i
        enjoyed the frontend more ans stuck to it since then. The year 2025
        would make it 5 years since i started my Software Engineering journey
        and i'm glad i did. I've done a few projects ranging from websites to
        CMS to E-commerce platforms and the experience has been different for
        each project. I'm also thankful for friends who supported me to start
        this journey i cant thank them enough. I'm grateful to have great minds in my life.

      <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Frontend Developer who has decided to learn cloud engineering in
        order to be able to build and do the cloud parts of her projects. I'm
        here because i know a few people who had gone through altschool and i
        knew they were taught well and i've also wanted to always apply to
        altschool from the first opening but i didn't have the funds at the time
        and i also didn't know about hte scholarship options until recently but
        i'm glad to be here and also learn.
